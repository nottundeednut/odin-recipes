      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The trick to making the best grilled cheese sandwich isn't just in the
        ingredients (mayonnaise and butter, together at last). It's also on the
        stove. Achieving a golden, crusty outside and oozy inside takes a little
        patience: if the heat is too high, the outside will scorch before the
        cheese melts. Cooking the slices separately at first gives the cheese a
        good head start. There's no need to search out artisanal loaves or local
        cheese (though they won't hurt), but definitely do not use homemade
        mayonnaise. Mustard, chutney or even strawberry jam (believe it) can be
        dabbed on the cheese as it melts, or add ham, prosciutto or slices of
        apple or tomato (drain on paper towels first). You can use any melting
        cheese, such as American, Muenster or Swiss, but not too much: part of
        the perfection here is in the proportion of bread to cheese.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Sliced Bread</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>
          1 to 2ounces grated cheddar (or other cheese), depending on size of
          bread
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy pan over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>
          Thinly spread one side of each bread slice with butter. Spread the
          other side of each slice with mayonnaise and place the bread,
          mayonnaise-side-down, in the pan. Divide the cheese evenly on top of
          the buttered slices. Adjust the heat so the bread sizzles gently.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the cheese is about halfway melted, use a spatula to flip one
          slice over on top of the other, and press lightly to melt. Keep
          turning the sandwich, pressing gently, until the sandwich is compact,
          both sides are crusty, and the cheese is melted.
